About Common Dialog/Direct
Common Dialog/Direct is a new DLL or class library which shows how to 
completely replace COMDLG32.OCX through Visual Basic code. The main 
advantage of this is you no longer need to put a control on a form to 
use common dialogs - just declare an instance of the class and you have 
a straight replacement. 

You can also incorporate the Common Dialog/Direct code straight into 
your own project if you want to reduce dependency files when you ship.

Common Dialog/Direct improves upon the standard COMDLG32.OCX features
by additionally incorporating a Page Setup dialog box and also a Common
Dialog hooks, allowing you to centre common dialogs and verify selections
before the dialog is closed.

Installation Requirements
Common Dialog/Direct requires Visual Basic 6 with at least Service 
Pack 3.
